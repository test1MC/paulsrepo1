        <p>By default, tracked changes are visible only in the editor in MadCap Flare, as well as in Central or Contributor (depending on the review method you are using). Tracked changes that have not yet been accepted are not visible when previewing the topic in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" /> or when viewing any output generated from it. You can preserve tracked changes in PDF&#160;and Word output so unaccepted changes will appear in these outputs. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Reviews-Contributions/Track-Changes/Preserving-Tracked-Changes.htm">Preserving Tracked Changes in PDF or Word Output</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
