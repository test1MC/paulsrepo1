        <p>In the Insert Image dialog, click <img src="../../../Images/Shared/All/browse_ellipses.png" />. Then find and select the image you want to use. In this tutorial, just select any image on your computer to see the results. In your actual project, you should try to choose an image with a size and aspect ratio that works well as a hero image. For example, in the Flare project template, the hero image is 5184 x 3456 pixels.</p>
