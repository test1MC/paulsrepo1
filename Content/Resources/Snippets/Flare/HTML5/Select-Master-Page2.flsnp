        <p>This tells Flare that, unless otherwise directed, all topics will use the master page you selected. But if you want to use a second master page, you can open the Properties dialog for a particular topic and point to a different master page. In that case, the master page set in the target is typically the one that the majority of your topics will use.  But for the other topic(s) using a different master page, you can override the target setting. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Flare/Master-Pages/Associating-Master-Pages-Topics.htm">Associating Master Pages with Topics</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
