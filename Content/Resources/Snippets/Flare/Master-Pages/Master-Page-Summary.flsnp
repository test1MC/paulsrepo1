        <p>A master page lets you apply certain content and elements (e.g., text, images, breadcrumbs, menus, toolbars, search bars) automatically to multiple topics in the output. A master page is primarily used in online outputs, but it can be used in Word output as well. For Word output, a master page lets you determine page specifications (such as size or orientation) and to apply certain content (e.g., header text or page numbers) to many topics in a manual. For print-based outputs other than Word, page layouts are used instead of master pages.</p>
