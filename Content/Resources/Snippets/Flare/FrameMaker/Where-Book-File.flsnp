        <p>There is no comparable BOOK file in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />. The Import FrameMaker Wizard converts the Adobe FrameMaker BOOK file and other documents to topic files and places them in a folder in the Content Explorer named for the imported Adobe FrameMaker BOOK file. </p>

            <p>Let's say you imported a FrameMaker BOOK file called "Getting Started Guide." Following the import, you can locate the converted content of that BOOK file in a folder named "Getting Started Guide" within the Content Explorer.</p>
