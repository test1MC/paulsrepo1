        <p>The Elasticsearch method is a powerful search engine you can use in your server-based online output. It gives your users  more accurate and efficient search results, and includes features such as predictive search, auto-completion, and fuzzy matches. This is enabled by the use of the MadCap Process Manager, which manages the Elasticsearch service and the Flare web service.</p>
