Therefore, we also provide support for a free alternative to Oracle's JDK. This alternative—Open JDK—can be used to support Elasticsearch on both local and remote servers made through the Content Services Portal. Both the Oracle and the Open JDK versions are available on <a href="https://www.madcapsoftware.com/downloads/java.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.madcapsoftware.com/downloads/java.aspx</a>.</p>
