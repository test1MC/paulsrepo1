        <p>If you have two tables in a <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Ca-Co-Fl/Topics/Content-File-Document.flsnp" /> that are positioned one after the other, you can merge those tables so that they become one. You can do this by using the paste icon <img src="../../../../Images/Shared/Co-Fl/paste_btn2.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> that may appear to the right of the tables.</p>
