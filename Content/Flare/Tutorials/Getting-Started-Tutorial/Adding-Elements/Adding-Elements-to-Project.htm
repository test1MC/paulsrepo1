        <p>Now that you have created a project, it is time to add content to it. Adding content gives your project some substance. You can add a variety of different features to a project. </p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">In this tutorial, you will add the following:</p>
        <ol MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Topics </span>You might say that topics are the most important part of a Flare project because they hold and display your content. See <MadCap:xref href="Topics.htm">Creating Topics</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Images </span>You can insert images into topics. Flare supports most common image file formats. See <MadCap:xref href="Images.htm">Inserting Images</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Cross-References </span>These are an easy way to navigate from one topic to another. See <MadCap:xref href="Cross-References.htm">Inserting Cross-References</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Drop-Down Text </span>This is a good way to segment a topic and make it easier for users to find and open specific content in it. See <MadCap:xref href="Drop-Down-Text.htm">Inserting Drop-Down Text</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Snippets </span>These are chunks of content that you can insert into multiple topics so that you don't have to keep copying and pasting, or re-adding the content. When you need to make a change to the content in the snippet, you only need to change it once; that change appears anywhere you used the snippet. See <MadCap:xref href="Snippets.htm">Using Snippets</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Tables </span>You can use tables for many reasons, such as comparing elements. See <MadCap:xref href="Tables.htm">Inserting Tables</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Variables </span>These are small bits of content that you can use over and over in your project. Unlike snippets, which are longer chunks of content, variables are usually a word, short term, or a number (e.g., your company name or phone number, or a date). Variables are stored in variable set files. See <MadCap:xref href="Variables.htm">Using Variables</MadCap:xref>.</li>
