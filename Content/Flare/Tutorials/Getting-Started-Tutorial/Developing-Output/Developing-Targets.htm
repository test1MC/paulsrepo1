        <p>After your project is styled, you are ready to start preparing your output files. You can set up different output types (e.g., PDF, HTML5, EPUB) and define settings that tell Flare what information to include in the final documents.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">The following are covered in this tutorial:</p>
        <ol MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Targets </span>Before you generate your final output, you need to create a target for each output type that you want to create. See <MadCap:xref href="Targets.htm">Targets</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Conditions </span>You can use condition tags to specify which content should appear in each output. For example, if you write a topic that does not need to be in your printed output, you can use a condition tag to exclude it when you build your output. You can use condition tags on any element in your project, including topics, paragraphs, images, snippets, and individual sentences. See <MadCap:xref href="Conditions.htm">Using Conditions</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Skins </span>In Flare, skins indicate how your online output should look. In this tutorial, you will learn how to set a logo in your skin. However, there are dozens of different skin settings. See <MadCap:xref href="Skins.htm">Skins</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Tables of Contents </span>If you are planning to create various kinds of outputs, you may want to set up different tables of contents for each one. This can make it easier to organize your topics for each of your outputs. See <MadCap:xref href="Table-of-Contents.htm">Using a Table of Contents</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
