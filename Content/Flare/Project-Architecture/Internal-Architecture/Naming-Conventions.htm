            <MadCap:keyword term="Project architecture;Architecture" />Naming Conventions</h1>
        <p>Put some thought into the way you name your folders and files, whether they are topics, snippets, images, targets, skins, etc. This is important not only for consistency, but also for potential effects on search results.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Many of your file and folder names are going to consist of more than one word. Here are some ways you can handle this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Hyphens (Recommended) </span>Hyphens provide visible separation between words and are recommended by some search engine optimization (SEO) experts.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Spaces </span>Adding spaces between words is simple. However, blank spaces can cause issues for Web servers, particularly those running UNIX or Linux. Also, in the browser path field, the characters “%20” will be inserted between each word (e.g., Choosing%20a%20Cat.htm instead of, say, Choosing-a-Cat.htm).</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">No Spaces </span>
                        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Search/Filename-No-Spaces.flsnp" />
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Underscores </span>
                        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Flare/Search/Filename-Underscores.flsnp" />
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Periods </span>It is recommended that you do not use periods (.) to separate words in file names. Periods are used by some computer systems to indicate different file extension types.</li>
                </ul>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>You might consider adding key words or letters at the beginning or end of certain names to make them easily identifiable and organized. For example, perhaps you have created 50 snippets that are specifically intended for a feature called “transmission.” Therefore, you might want to begin the name for each of those snippets with that word (e.g., transmission-getting-started.flsnp, transmission-initial-steps.flsnp, transmission-note-1.flsnp).</p>

                <p>Here is what we do for naming conventions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Hyphens </span>For both file and folder names, we use hyphens between words. There are some older files that still use our older convention where words run together, but as time permits, we are changing those to use hyphens as well.</li>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Initial Caps </span>We use uppercase for the first letter of the main words.</li>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Length </span>There are some topics that have somewhat long headings out of necessity. However, even in those situations, we try to limit the length of the actual file name, leaving out minor words, such as articles.</li>
                    <li><span class="Emphasis">Keywords and Letters </span>For some file names, we use certain keywords or letters. For example:<ul class="SecondLevel"><li>All of our main landing pages start with the word “About” (e.g., “About-Page-Layouts.htm,” “About-Search.htm”). It just makes it easier to identify them.</li><li>We might have many snippets about a particular feature, so we will start the name of each snippet file with the name of that feature (e.g., “Elasticsearch-Summary.flsnp,” “Elasticsearch-Install-Steps.flsnp”). </li><li>For small images of buttons in the user interface, we add the letters “btn” at the end of the image file name (e.g., “Save-btn.png,” “Search-btn.png,” “Font-btn.png”). This tells us at a glance exactly what kind of an image it is without having to open it.</li></ul></li>
