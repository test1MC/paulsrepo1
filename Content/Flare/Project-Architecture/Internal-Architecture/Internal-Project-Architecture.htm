            <MadCap:keyword term="Project architecture;Architecture" />Internal Project Architecture</h1>
        <p>Internal project architecture has to do with the structure of files and use of features within a Flare project. Whatever approach and features you adopt, remember that consistency is important. Establishing consistent rules and guidelines will result in a cleaner project. It also makes it easier to locate files, which is especially important for teams of writers.</p>
