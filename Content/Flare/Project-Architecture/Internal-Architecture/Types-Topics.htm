            <MadCap:concept term="FilterFeatures" />Types of Topics</h1>
        <p>The main types of topics created in Flare are essentially the same as those found in DITA:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Concept </span>This is a topic that describes the meaning, background, and context for a subject. These are often “landing” topics, which usually provide links or navigation to related topics.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reference </span>This is a topic that is designed to store detailed reference information, often in one or more tables.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Task </span>This is a topic that provides steps for completing procedures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, you are not limited to these three types. You might find a need for others in your projects.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>It is a good idea to set internal standards and design a basic structure for each type of topic you need to use. For example, your team might determine that each task topic should include the following elements, in order and perhaps written in a particular way:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heading</li>
                    <li>Summary paragraph(s)</li>
                    <li>Task heading</li>
                    <li>Steps</li>
                    <li>Tips</li>
                    <li>Notes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using topic templates is a good way to ensure consistency when creating each of these types of topics. You can include a skeleton structure for each topic type, with dummy text that authors replace in new topics. See <MadCap:xref href="../External-Architecture/Templates.htm">Templates</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p>You can also make a copy of an existing topic of the same type and then replace the content with new information. However, use caution when doing this because some information might be unique to the original topic (e.g., meta description, master page), and you need to adjust that information as well in new topics.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>You might consider using certain standards when naming your topics to help organize and identify them. For example, you might begin topics with the words “Concept,” “Reference,” or “Task,” depending on its type (e.g., Concept-Dog-Overview.htm, Reference-Dog-Breeds.htm, Task-Training-Dogs.htm).</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody class="Final">
                <p>We use the main topic types, plus a couple of others:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Concept</li>
                    <li>Reference</li>
                    <li>Task</li>
                    <li>Troubleshooting</li>
                    <li>UI element</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our troubleshooting topics are actually a subset of the task type, but we wanted them to stand out from the rest of the task topics. In the same way, the UI element topics are a subset of the reference task type.</p>
                <p>We have created templates—skeleton versions of each of our five topic types—and placed them in a network folder. When creating new topics, these templates can be used by any author on the team.</p>
