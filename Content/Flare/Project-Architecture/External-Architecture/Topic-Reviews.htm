        <p>Most authors require some kind of a process for others to review their Flare documentation, as well as to contribute new content when necessary. There are several ways you can do this, depending on your resources and knowledge of your reviewers and contributors.</p>
        <p>Following are the most common methods, although you might use another solution not listed here.</p>

                <p>If you need a fellow Flare author to review content, a convenient solution is simply for both authors stay within the Flare project. There are a couple of ways to do this.</p>
                <p>First, the original author can communicate (verbally, via email, etc.), asking another author to review the file(s). The reviewer opens the file(s), tracks his or her changes<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only"> (see <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews-Contributions/Track-Changes/Enabling-Track-Changes.htm">Enabling Track Changes</MadCap:xref>)</MadCap:conditionalText>, and makes edits and/or annotations. The reviewer lets the original author know the files have been reviewed. The original author opens those files and accepts or rejects the changes,.</p>

                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Flare/pa-reviews1.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <p>A second way to use Flare for reviews between authors is to use the option in the Review ribbon to send files for review (in a review package). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews-Contributions/Reviews/Sending-Files-for-Review.htm">Sending Files for Review</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
                <p>After the reviewer finishes and returns the files, the original author can view the tracked changes, accepting or rejecting them as necessary. That author can  then click a button to accept a reviewed file, replacing the original file with the reviewed one. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews-Contributions/Reviews/Accepting-Reviewed-Files.htm">Accepting Reviewed Files</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/For-More-Info/See-Online-Help.flsnp" MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" /></p>

                <p>For reviews, you send files to the person in a review package. That individual opens Contributor, which is like a scaled-down version of Flare. Changes are automatically tracked, and the reviewer can also add annotations, then send the review package back to you. After accepting or rejecting changes in those files, you can accept them back into the Flare project, replacing the original source files. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reviews-Contributions/Review-Workflow-Sending.htm">Review Workflow—Sending to Others</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

                <p>We use the review process available with MadCap Central, following these guidelines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We limit the snippets that are included with reviews. It is more likely that we include larger snippets in a topic, while excluding many of the smaller snippets. We feel that including too many snippets as part of the review process can confuse reviewers, especially SMEs, who might not be familiar with snippets. So we communicate with reviewers to open and edit the snippets that we do include, but to insert annotations as necessary next to the read-only snippets that are excluded from the process.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Our reviews are sent from our “Develop” projects, rather than from our main “Shared” project. That’s because our “Develop” projects on Central include files that are in a state of development, whereas the “Shared” project on Central includes only published files. This is all a result of our branching process with source control. See <MadCap:xref href="Source-Control.htm">Source Control</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                        <p>This means we currently only use about 90% of Central’s review process. The final part of the process—incorporating reviewed files back in to Flare—is done manually, rather than automatically. The reason for this is that we need to get the reviewed changes back into our “Shared” project, but the reviews are actually occurring in our child “Develop” projects. Once Central supports source control branching (allowing us to send reviews from our “Shared” project), we will be using 100% of the Central review process.</p>
                        <p>However, although we use only 90% of the process, we decided that the benefits still outweigh the other review options, especially the ability to allow multiple individuals review the same file simultaneously.</p>
