        <p>You might be wondering how many Flare projects you should create. Should you put all of your content into one big project, should you split it out into several smaller projects, or should you do some of both? And if you create multiple projects that are related, which features or tools should you use? There isn’t just one answer that fits everyone’s situation. You will need to explore the different possibilities and consider the pros and cons of each. You might even want to create some small sample projects and test different methods.</p>
        <p>Following are some possible project designs you might consider, and the features and tools that can be used.</p>

                <p>The simplest structure is obviously to have only one Flare project, generating output from it as needed. A single project might contain files for only one purpose (e.g., to document one product or one subject), or it might contain files for many purposes (e.g., to document many products or subjects). Also, this project might be used by a single author or many authors.</p>

                <p>With this type of structure, you have more than one Flare project, with one or more “child” projects importing common files from a “parent” project via Global Project Linking. Rather than this being a one-time import process, a connection exists between the parent and child projects, allowing ongoing maintenance of the files to take place in the parent project and then periodically imported to the child projects. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Global-Project-Linking/About-Global-Project-Linking.htm">About Global Project Linking</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/For-More-Info/See-Online-Help.flsnp" MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" /></p>
                <p>Because any project can serve as the parent project or as a child project, you have some flexibility in how you create your structure.</p>
                <p>The most common structure has only one project serving as the parent, with child projects importing files from it. With the parent working merely as a repository, the outputs would be generated from the child projects.</p>

                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" />

                <p>A less common solution—but certainly a possible one—might involve more than one parent project, with certain files imported between any projects you want. </p>

Just know that those kinds of files tend to have links to other topics and snippets. And those other topics and snippets have links too. So when you import these types of files that have many links, you also need the files they’re linked to. In that way, it is somewhat like a set of dominoes falling over. And before you know it, you’re importing a far more files than originally intended and you need to consider whether you’ve passed your imaginary threshold.</p>

Even if you have those missing files conditioned out so that they do not affect outputs, the indication of missing files can cause extra time and effort to ensure everything is working as it should.</p>

                <p>This structure involves multiple projects that are connected in a way that the source files are merged into a single online output. The merging is based on the table of contents (or browse sequence) in one master project, where links point to one or more other child projects. So when you build output from the master project, it brings in all that content from the child projects, and it looks like one seamless output from a single project, but it’s actually made up of multiple projects. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../TOCs/Merging-Projects.htm">Merging Projects</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/For-More-Info/See-Online-Help.flsnp" MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" /></p>

                <p>If you have translated your project into other languages, you can link Lingo projects or additional translated Flare projects to your master project to create multilingual output.

                <p>Our structure has evolved over the years. At one time, our documentation for various products was split into individual projects. We then implemented Global Project Linking, with common files being imported into each child project. However, with so many files being imported, we eventually decided that it made more sense for our purposes to move all of the product documentation into a single project. Although this main project is quite large, it does not seem to be so big that it is causing any unmanageable issues. We continue to use Global Project Linking for a couple of different reasons, which are explained below.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Shared/DB-Fl/pa-projects.png" alt="" title="" class="MaxWidth100Percent" />
                </p>
                <MadCap:pageBreak MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" />
                <p>Our structure involves the following three kinds of projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Shared </span>We have one main Flare project called “Shared,” where most work occurs on the various products that we need to document (e.g., Flare, Central, Doc-to-Help, Lingo). All of the output intended for end users is generated from this project.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Documentation Bible </span>This project is used for internal information (e.g., documentation team processes, procedures, style guide). Most of the editing is done directly in this project, but we also import some resource files (e.g., stylesheets, page layouts, variables, skins) from the Shared project via Global Project Linking. This project is bound to MadCap Central, where we build output intended for internal consumption.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">“Develop” Projects </span>These are smaller projects, each one based on one of the MadCap products (e.g., “Central - Develop,” “D2H-Develop,” “Lingo-Develop”). Based on conditions that are set on files in the main “Shared” project, we import all of the files for a particular product via Global Project Linking. We do not edit any of these child projects.  These child projects are basically versions of the documentation <span class="EmphasisItalic">as it’s being developed, not the finished result</span>. It has a lot to do with source control and specifically with branching (see <MadCap:xref href="Source-Control.htm">Source Control</MadCap:xref>). Like the Documentation Bible, these projects are bound to Central. Within Central, we use these child projects for creating and managing tasks, checklists, and topic reviews. They are also used for distributing internal output.</li>
