This includes broken links or bookmarks, files with changes, topics not in a table of contents (TOC), and much more. You can also generate reports from the Project Organizer. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online-Only">See <MadCap:xref href="../../Analysis/About-Analysis-and-Reports.htm">About Analysis and Reports</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/All/For-More-Info/See-Online-Help.flsnp" MadCap:conditions="Flare-Guides.Flare-Architecture-Guide" /></p>

                <p>Any or all of these tools can provide you with valuable information. The information that you glean from Flare’s analysis feature is going to be somewhat different from the reports in the other tools. It’s best to research each of the methods to see which tool is returning the most valuable information for your needs. You might decide to use multiple tools.</p>

                <p>When we get close to a product release, we scan the files in our main “Shared” Flare project to discover the following information about our source files:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Critical Issues </span>These are problems that must be fixed, such as broken links or bookmarks.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Files with Annotations </span>We occasionally insert annotations in topics and snippets as reminders to do something before a topic is considered complete. Scanning the project for files with annotations lets us quickly locate these instances and take action if necessary.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Topics Without Concepts </span>We use concept keywords in order to create search filter sets, as well as boost search results for certain topics. Therefore, we run this scan to make sure all necessary topics contain concept keywords.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Topics Not In Index </span>We do not use an index for online output, but we do for some PDF targets. Also, index keywords can help boost search results for topics. So we run this scan to make sure we have inserted index keywords where necessary.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Unused Images </span>After a release is finished, we run this scan to find obsolete images that can be removed from the project.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After a release is finished, we run the “Unused Images” scan on the relevant “Develop” child project (e.g., “Central-Develop,” “Lingo-Develop”) to find obsolete images that can be removed from the project. We like to run this scan on a child project instead of the main “Shared” project because it allows us to isolate the images that are intended only for that product. If we were to run the scan on our main project, we might see many unused images for other products that we may not really want to remove.</p>
                <p>There are many other project analysis scans that you can run, but the ones listed above are those that we focus on.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, we run text analysis on certain files, especially more complex ones, to make sure their readability level is acceptable.</p>
