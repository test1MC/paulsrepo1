        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>You can manage a Lingo project in several different ways.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Starting Projects </span>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Creating Projects </span>You can create a new Lingo translation project using the Start New Project Wizard. This wizard lets you select from many different kinds of files, as well as specify one or more target languages. You can also add entire folders to a project and then select the file types you want to translate. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Projects/Creating-Lingo-Projects.htm">Creating New Projects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Opening Projects </span>There are multiple ways to open an existing project. You can use interface options or drag files from Windows Explorer. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Projects/Opening-Lingo-Projects.htm">Opening Projects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Adding Files </span>You can add additional files to a project after the project has been created.  This lets you make changes to your Lingo project at any time without needing to create a new project. It also prevents you from having to send multiple projects to a translator or a reviewer. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Projects/Adding-Files-to-Projects.htm">Adding Files to Projects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Updating Projects </span>Let's say you have already created a Lingo project for an earlier version of a particular project or document. You have already translated it, exported it to a new project or file, and given it to the author. Sometime after this, the author makes many changes to the project or file (in the source language). Now the author needs you to translate those changes into the target language. To do this, you can update your Lingo project. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Projects/Updating-Projects.htm">Updating Projects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Exporting Projects </span>When you finish translating all of the content in a project or file, you can export your work to the application, file, or location. For example, if you translated a Flare project, you can export your work out to a new Flare project; if you have translated a Word document, you can export your work out to a new Word document. The content developer can then open this translated project or file and create output for it. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Exporting/Exporting-Translated-Projects.htm">Exporting Translated Projects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Multilingual Projects </span>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Lingo/Multilingual/Multilingual-Introduction.flsnp" /> See <MadCap:xref href="../../Language-Support/About-Multilingual-Projects.htm">About Multilingual Projects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Command Line </span>You can manage a Lingo project using the command line, in which case you do not have to open Lingo at all. The command line lets you export or update/sync Lingo projects. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Projects/Managing-Projects-Command-Prompt.htm">Managing Projects Using the Command Line</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Reports </span>When working with translations in <MadCap:variable name="Other.Product" />, you can generate statistics and quality assurance reports to see the status of your translation project. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reports/Computing-Statistics.htm">Computing Statistics</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../Reports/Running-QA-Reports.htm">Running Quality Assurance Reports</MadCap:xref>.</li>
