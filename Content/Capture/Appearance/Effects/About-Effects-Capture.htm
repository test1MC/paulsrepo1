                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Blur effects;Effects:blur" />Blur&#160;</span>You can draw a shape around an area of an image that you want to emphasize and then apply the blur effect, determining how much "blurriness" is used. The area inside the shape remains clear, but the rest of the image around the shape becomes blurred. You can even have multiple shapes on an image, each with a blur effect. See <MadCap:xref href="Blur-Effects/Adding-Blur-Effects-Capture.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding Blur Effects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Blur effects;Effects:blur;Objects:blur effects;Shapes:blur effects" />Blur-Inside&#160;</span>You can draw a shape around an area of an image that you want to hide and then apply the blur-inside effect, determining how much "blurriness" is used. The area inside the shape is blurred, but the rest of the image around the shape remains clear. You can even have multiple shapes on an image, each with a blur-inside effect. See <MadCap:xref href="Blur-Effects/Adding-Blur-Inside-Effects-Capture.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding Blur-Inside Effects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Gray scale;Effects:gray scale;Objects:gray scale effects" />Gray Scale&#160;</span>You can draw a shape around an area of an image that you want to emphasize and then apply the gray scale effect. The area inside the shape remains displayed in the original color, but the rest of the image around the shape is displayed in gray. You can even have multiple shapes on an image, each with a gray scale effect. See <MadCap:xref href="Gray-Scale-Effects/Adding-Gray-Scale-Effects-Capture.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding Gray Scale Effects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Shading effects;Effects:shading" />Shading&#160;</span>You can draw a shape around an area of an image that you want to emphasize and then apply the shading effect, determining the amount of darkness or lightness of the shading. The area inside the shape remains clear, but the rest of then image around the shape becomes shaded. You can even have multiple shapes on an image, each with a shading effect. See <MadCap:xref href="Shading-Effects/Adding-Shading-Effects-Capture.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding Shading Effects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Objects:shadow effects;Shadow effects;Effects:shadow" /><MadCap:keyword term="Shadow effects;Effects:shadow" />Shadow&#160;</span>
                        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Shared/Ca-Mi/Effects/Shadow-Effects-Summary.flsnp" /> See <MadCap:xref href="Shadow-Effects/Adding-Shadow-Effects-Capture.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding Shadow Effects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Torn edge effects;Effects:torn edge;Image objects:torn edge" />Torn Edge&#160;</span>You can easily add an effect around an image or image object to give it the appearance of having a torn edge. For more information about applying a torn edge to an image, see <MadCap:xref href="Torn-Edge-Effects/Adding-Torn-Edge-Effects-Capture.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding Torn Edge Effects</MadCap:xref>. For more information about torn edges and image objects, see <MadCap:xref href="../Editing-Image-Objects-Capture.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Editing Image Objects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Objects:zoom effects;Zoom effects;Effects:zoom" />Zoom&#160;</span>You can add a zoom effect to an object. This creates a 3D effect that magnifies (and therefore emphasizes) a specific area in an image so that it appears closer than the rest of the image. When you create a zoom effect, you have control over the appearance of the effect, including the position of the enlarged area and the percentage at which the area is magnified. See <MadCap:xref href="Zoom-Effects/Adding-Zoom-Effects-Capture.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Adding Zoom Effects</MadCap:xref>.</li>
